With the constant growing demand and love for the game of football, the interest for tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhanced viewer experiences has also increased significantly. This project develops a system for the automated detection and tracking of football players, referees, and the football during the game. It achieves this by building upon state-of-the-art object detection models and tracking algorithms.

For real-time object detection, the system leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once). On the other hand, K-Means Clustering and the SIGLIP Model are used for player team classification, whereas, ByteTrack is used to obtain an overall robust multi-object tracking system. 

The system further goes on to generate a Bird's Eye View using the concepts of homography. This plays a key role in generating heatmaps and off-side lines which can be of great aid for spatial and tactical analysis. The system also does a comprehensive analysis, returning the speed and distance travelled by each player during the match.

This work highlights the potential of deep learning-based methods in advancing sports analytics and lays the core foundation upon which, further enhancements such event recognition, action recognition, and integration with match analysis can be built.

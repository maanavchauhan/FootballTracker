I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout the course of this project. I am especially thankful to my supervisor, Prof. Afroditi Galata, for her valuable guidance, feedback, and encouragement at every stage of the project. Her insights were instrumental in shaping the direction of this project and overcoming technical challenges.

I would also like to thank the Department of Computer Science for providing the necessary resources and academic environment that made this project possible. Special thanks to my peers and friends for their helpful discussions and moral support, and to the creators of Roboflow and the developers of YOLO and ByteTrack, whose tools and open-source contributions formed the backbone of this implementation.

Finally, I am grateful to my family for their constant encouragement and patience throughout this journey.
